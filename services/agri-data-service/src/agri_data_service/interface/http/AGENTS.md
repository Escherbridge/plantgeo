# `interface/http/` — thin Sanic adapter for Parquet operations

This directory owns only the Sanic blueprint and HTTP transport policy. All parsing, state
resolution, coverage, DuckDB sessions, admission control, object reads, typed refusals, and wire
rendering live in top-level `agri_data_service.parquet_ops`.

## Invariants

- `parquet_routes.py` is the sole HTTP adapter. No second HTTP-facing implementation or alias lives
  beside it.
- Every resolved four-state envelope leaves as HTTP 200. A refusal is serving/transport state, never
  warehouse content.
- Core `ServingRefusalError` carries only `code` and `message`; `_REFUSAL_HTTP_STATUS` owns the
  complete code-to-status mapping. A core module must never import an HTTP constant.
- Row operations use `run_serving_read`; coverage uses `run_bounded_read`. No adapter opens a DuckDB
  connection or owns a pool/semaphore.
- The private origin and route spelling remain frozen by `tests/contract/wire_contract.py` and the
  TypeScript client contract.
- Timeouts stay below the caller budgets so the adapter can return the typed reason.
